Welcome to OpenRelativity! This project is a spin-off from the MIT Game Lab's game A Slower Speed of Light.

OpenRelativity is a set of tools for simulating the effects of traveling near the speed of light in the Unity3D game engine. We are producing this simple engine in the hopes that more developers or educators can use our toolset to produce more simulations or explorations of travel near the speed of light.

Within this readme is a quick overview of each piece of code that we have put into this project, along with a very quick description of how to use the toolset to make sure your project follows the rules of relativity. We hope you can use this toolset to produce something amazing, and if you find bugs or have an improvement to make to the code base, feel free to help turn OpenRelativity into an even better project.


How to use OpenRelativity:

With our code base, there are a few simple rules around how to get an object into the Unity environment and have it work with our tools. We will start with the player object itself, and then other objects throughout the scene.

The Player:

The player is already set up with our movement code, game state code, and a quick script that puts the speed of light and player speed on the screen. It is set up as a nested object. The player mesh is the parent object, which has the physical aspects of the player. It has a mesh renderer, a collider, and a rigidbody. Each of these components is necessary for our code base. Any of these attributes can be modified, but if the rigidbody's drag, gravity, or frozen rotation settings are changed, the project will no longer adhere to the rules of special relativity
